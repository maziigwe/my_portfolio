            I enjoy participating in all the stages of the sofware development
            cycle; from developing reusable UI components using React.js &
            Typescript, to building and integrating the backend API using
            Node.js, Express server & MongoDB.
            <br />
            <br />I create scalable, maintainable, fun, innovative, accessible
            and fast websites. I try to make all lines of my code more readable,
            modular, performant and accessible than I found it, to make life
            easier for my team.
            <br />

            In all my previous roles, I have contributed collaboration,
            innovation, and leadership toward team efforts and business
            improvements. I am progressive minded and in tune with new
            developments in my in the Software development industry. I have
            proven to be effective and collaborative with strong communication
            skill, proven presentation and leadership skill. I enjoy collective
            brainstorming sessions which allows me to coordinate activities to
            achieve a common goal.
