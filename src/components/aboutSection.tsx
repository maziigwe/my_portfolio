            <br />
            I enjoy participating in all the stages of the sofware development
            cycle; from design to developing reusable UI components using
            React.js & Typescript, to building and integrating the backend API
            using Node.js, Express server & MongoDB.
            <br />
            <br />I create scalable, maintainable, fun, innovative, accessible
            and fast websites. I try to make all lines of my code more readable,
            modular, performant and accessible than I found it, to make life
            easier for my team.
            <br />
            <br />
            In all my previous roles, I have contributed innovation, and
            leadership towards team efforts and business improvements. I am
            progressive minded and in tune with new technologies in the Software
            development industry. I have proven to be effective and
            collaborative with strong communication skills, proven presentation
            and leadership skill. I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions
            which allows me to coordinate activities to achieve a common goal.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond Software engineering, I am also passionate about writing,
            mentoring and sharing my knowledge and experince with my mentees and
            teammates through social media.
